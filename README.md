# PESTA project

This project was develop for the PESTA subject for my Engineer's degree at ISEP.

## Introduction

This project consists in the development of an educational platform to support the teaching and learning of control strategies associated with the inverters.
This platform is developed using two programming languages: JavaScript for data processing and HTML for the graphical interface.
Three control strategies are addressed: PWM, SPWM and SVM.

### Technologies stack used

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for codes developed in JavaScript to interact with the corresponding HTML page.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to develop the graphical interface.

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is used to develop the source code for each strategy.

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is used to save the style of the graphical interface.
